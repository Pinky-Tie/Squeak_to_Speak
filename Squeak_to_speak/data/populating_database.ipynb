Greenberg \\nJeremy D. Safran \\nYork University \\nClarke Institute of Psychiatry \\nABSTRACT.\" The therapeutic process involves many dif- \\nferent types of affective phenomena. No single therapeutic \\nperspective has been able to encompass within its own \\ntheoretical framework all the ways in which emotion plays \\na role in therapeutic change. A comprehensive, constructive \\ntheory of emotion helps transcend the differences in the \\ntherapeutic schools by viewing emotion as a complex syn- \\nthesis of expressive motor, schematic, and conceptual in- \\nformation that provides organisms with information about \\ntheir responses to situations that helps them orient adap- \\ntively in the environment. In addition to improved theory, \\nincreased precision in the assessment of affective func- \\ntioning in therapy, as well as greater specification of dif- \\nferent emotional change processes and means of facili- \\ntating these, will allow the role of emotion in change to \\nbe studied more effectively. A number of different change \\nprocesses involving emotion are discussed, as well as \\nprinciples of emotionally focused intervention that help \\naccess emotion and promote emotional restructuring. \\nThe cognitive revolution in psychology has had a pre- \\ndictable, although initially unanticipated effect--it has \\nbrought emotional processes, once relegated to the do- \\nmain of the subjective, into central focus for empirical \\nand theoretical investigation. There has recently been a \\nrapid expansion of new information relevant to the anal- \\nysis of emotion (Buck, 1984, 1985; Izard, 1979; Lazarus, \\n1984; Lewis & Michalson, 1983; Plutchik, 1980; Zajonc, \\n1980, 1984) and a growing realization that behavior can \\nbe initiated and influenced by emotional as well as cog- \\nnitive processes. In fact, the traditional distinctions drawn \\namong affect, cognition, and behavior have rapidly been \\nbreaking down and have been replaced by emerging in- \\ntegrative information processing models of functioning \\n(Buck, 1985; Lung, 1985; Leventhal, 1979, 1984). In these \\nmodels, emotion is seen as the product of a synthesis of \\nconstitutive elements at the physiological and expressive \\nmotor level, at the semantic and schematic level, and at \\nthe linguistic and conceptual level. \\nIn psychotherapy, a similar trend toward studying \\naffective functioning has recently emerged (Bradbury & \\nFincham, 1987; Foa & Kozak, 1986; Greenberg & John- \\nson, 1986a, 1988; Greenberg & Safran, 1981, 1984a, \\n1987a, 1987b; Guidano & Liotti, 1983; Johnson & \\nGreenberg, 1985a, 1985b; Mahoney, 1984; Rachman, \\n1980, 1981; Safran & Greenberg, 1982a, 1982b, 1986). \\nWe will suggest in this article that emotional processes \\nin psychotherapy are of central importance in under- \\nstanding and promoting certain types of therapeutic \\nchange and that it is now timely and necessary for the \\npsychotherapy field to develop an integrative and empir- \\nically informed perspective on the role of emotion in \\nchange. This will provide an orienting framework for in- \\nvestigating the diverse array of different emotional phe- \\nnomena traditionally focused on by different therapy tra- \\nditions. \\nPsychotherapeutic Approaches to Emotion \\nPsychotherapists have long concerned themselves with \\nworking with people\\'s emotional experience. Different \\ntheoretical perspectives have tended to emphasize differ- \\nent aspects of emotional functioning. As a result, the psy- \\nchotherapy literature has failed to produce an integrative, \\ncomprehensive perspective on emotion capable of illu- \\nminating the full array of emotional phenomena relevant \\nto psychotherapy. In this section, we will briefly highlight \\nsome of the important themes characterizing three of the \\nmajor therapeutic perspectives on emotion: psychoanal- \\nysis, behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapies, and \\nthe experiential tradition. \\nFrom the outset, psychoanalysis has had an appre- \\nciation of the role of neglected emotion in human affairs. \\nIn psychodynamic therapy, affect has played a variety of \\ndifferent roles. Emotion was seen initially as psychic en- \\nergy. The strangulation of affect was seen as the main \\ncause of hysteria with abreaction as the cure (Freud, \\n1895). Wilhelm Reich (1949) later emphasized abreaction \\nand the sustained expression of emotion throughout \\ntherapy as an important curative factor. Modem cathartic \\ntherapies (e.g., Janov, 1970), which evolved from this \\nperspective, have emphasized the expression of emotion, \\nbut without the awareness and analysis of defenses that \\nReich also saw as crucial. \\nLater Freud ( 1910) abandoned the abreaction model \\nand theorized that when the quantity of psychic energy \\nbecame excessive it was discharged in the form of emo- \\ntion. Thus, emotion came to be seen as a discharge process \\nassociated with instinctual impulses rather than as psychic \\nenergy. Some modern analysts, following Rapaport \\n(1967), have used this drive discharge model and have \\nhypothesized that given that emotions are a mode of drive \\ndischarge, the failure to \"express feelings\" is tantamount \\nto drive repression and is the cause of neurotic behavior. \\nAlthough Rapaport (1967) was not completely clear on \\nthis point, it appears that he viewed emotional expression \\nas a preferred sublimatory route for drive discharge and \\nbelieved that psychotherapeutic work should encourage \\nthe expression of pent-up feelings to help control instinc- \\ntual strivings. \\nOther psychodynamic perspectives emphasize that \\nJanuary 1989 • American Psychologist \\nCopyright 1989 by the American Psychological Association.

Either transference interpretations or \\ncorrective emotional experience with the therapist are \\nthen seen as curative (Alexander & French, 1946; \\nStrachey, 1934). Thus, in these views, fully experiencing \\naffective responses in the context of a therapeutic rela- \\ntionship is seen as a prerequisite for correcting distortions \\nof the object world. \\nWithin the broader psychodynamic arena, object \\nrelations and interpersonal perspectives construe affect as \\na motivational tendency that connects the organism with \\nits environment both through action tendencies and \\ncommunication (Basch, 1976; Fairbairn, 1962; Sullivan, \\n1953). Affective experience and expression are seen as \\nbeing centrally involved in need satisfaction, and the \\nowning of disclaimed action tendencies is seen as thera- \\npeutic (Eagle, 1984; Schafer, 1983). In therapy, interper- \\nsonal theorists stress interpretations that help people to \\nbe attuned to their interpersonal needs and to express \\nthem in a spontaneous fashion. \\nIn summary, in the classical psychoanalytic view, \\nemotions are seen generally as drive related and as needing \\nto be discharged or tamed, whereas in interpersonal ap- \\nproaches, emotions are seen as socially adaptive orienting \\ntendencies. Although psychoanalytic therapy has always \\nstressed the importance of acknowledging disavowed af- \\nfect, recent theoretical developments have come to view \\nthis warded-off affect as a form of disclaimed action (Ea- \\ngle, 1984; Schafer, 1983). \\nIn contrast to psychoanalytic theory, which began \\nby focusing on the pathogenic nature of repressed or di- \\nsavowed affect, behavioral theory focused on the clinical \\nproblem of modifying undesirable affective states, such \\nas anxiety and depression, and this approach has become \\nparadigmatic of the behavioral tradition. \\nTwo contending themes have dominated behavioral \\nviews of emotion. Proponents of the first perspective view \\nthe individual as a tabula rasa who learns emotional re- \\nsponses in relation to environmental contingencies \\n(Skinner, 1953). Those who adhere to the second per- \\nspective view emotion as stemming at least in part from \\ninnate propensities or predispositions (Rachman, 1978). \\nBoth of these perspectives have led to the development \\nof treatment strategies involving deconditioning and ex- \\nposure. In addition to graduated exposure treatments, \\nimplosion and flooding have also been used to prevent \\navoidance behavior and extinguish or habituate anxiety \\nresponses. Repeated exposure to fear situations, whether \\ngradual or total, imaginal or in vivo, has been a key in- \\ngredient in the behavioral approach to the treatment of \\nanxiety. Thus, in the behavioral perspective, the need for \\nthe elimination of maladaptive emotional responses is \\ntypically stressed. Rachman's (1980) recent theoretical \\nwork on emotional processing attempts to expand the \\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be adressed to Leslie S. \\nGreenberg, Department of Psychology, York University, 4700 Keele St., \\nNorth York, Ontario, Canada M3J 1P3. \\nbehavioral perspective on emotion to account for affective \\nchange phenomena in a variety of different approaches \\nto therapy. Although this perspective is in an early phase \\nof development, it does indicate the growing interest in \\ndeveloping a broader theoretical perspective on the role \\nof emotion in the behavioral tradition. \\nIn the cognitive behavioral approaches, affect has \\ntraditionally been seen as a postcognitive phenomena. \\nCognitive behavioral theory has maintained that the \\nmeaning of an event determines the emotional response \\nto it (Beck, 1976; Ellis, 1962). Constructs such as auto- \\nmatic thoughts, irrational beliefs, and self statements have \\nbeen posited as mediating between events and emotional \\nresponses to events, and cognitive therapists have tended \\nto focus on the elimination of emotional responses to \\nfaulty cognitions by rationally challenging beliefs, by \\nproviding schema-inconsistent evidence, and by providing \\nself-instructional training. \\nThis is a time of theoretical ferment in the cognitive \\nperspective on emotion. A number of theorists are chal- \\nlenging traditional assumptions about the relationship \\nbetween emotion and cognition and are exploring the \\nfunctional role of emotion in the human information \\nprocessing system (Greenberg & Safran, 1981, 1984a, \\n1987a, 1987b; Guidano, 1987; Guidano & Liotti, 1983; \\nLiotti, 1986, 1987; Mahoney, 1984, 1987; Safran & \\nGreenberg, 1982a, 1986, in press). \\nIn contrast to those who hold cognitive and behav- \\nioral views, experiential and humanistic therapists have \\nalways regarded emotion as an important motivator of \\nchange. In these traditions, emotions are conceptualized \\nneither as expressions of instinctual impulses nor as \\nlearned responses. Rather, affect is seen as an orienting \\nsystem that provides the organism with adaptive infor- \\nmation. \\nIn client-centered therapy, experiencing, defined as \\nall that is going on within the organism that is currently \\navailable to awareness (Rogers, 1959), has been a central \\nconstruct. To experience means to receive the impact of \\nsensory and physiological events occurring in the mo- \\nment. Feeling was defined by Rogers (1959) as a complex \\ncognitive affective unit composed of emotionally toned \\nexperience and its cognized meaning. He claimed that \\ntherapeutic change involved experiencing fully in aware- \\nness feelings that had in the past been denied awareness \\nor had been distorted. \\nIn gestalt therapy (Perls, Hefferline, & Goodman, \\n195 l), although the experience and expression of emotion \\nis regarded to be of critical importance to change, there \\nis still little systematic theory about its role in the ther- \\napeutic process. Emotion is regarded as the organism's \\ndirect, evaluative, immediate experience of the organism/ \\nenvironment field, furnishing the basis of awareness of \\nwhat is important to the organism and organizing action. \\nDysfunction occurs when emotions are interrupted before \\nthey can enter awareness or go very far in organizing ac- \\ntion. Gestalt therapists see avoidance of painful feelings \\nand the fear of unwanted emotion as the core of many \\nproblems (Perls, Hefferline, & Goodman, 1951). \\n20 \\nJanuary 1989 • American Psychologist \\n\"),\n",

The goal of therapy is not to get rid of \\nfeelings but to help clients become aware of their meaning \\nand to become more responsive to the action tendencies \\ntoward which feelings prompt them. Whether the tech- \\nnique involves empathic responding to clients\\' experi- \\nencing (Rogers, 1957) or the creation of experiments \\n(Greenberg & Kahn, 1978; Polster & Polster, 1973) to \\nincrease clients\\' awareness of both emotional experience \\nand of processes that interrupt emotional experience \\n(Perls, 1973), the goal is to increase clients\\' awareness of \\nemotion so that it is available as orienting information \\nto help them deal with the environment. \\n\"The views discussed here reflect a wide range of dif- \\nferent perspectives on the role of emotions in human \\nfunctioning and in therapy. This diversity has resulted in \\nthe development of different theoretical models of the \\nrole of emotion in therapeutic change and different clin- \\nical techniques. \\nEmpirical Evidence \\nThe empirical work on emotion in psychotherapy has \\nlagged behind the theoretical and practical developments \\nin this area. Empirical evidence relevant to the under- \\nstanding of the role and efficacy of different emotional \\nchange processes in psychotherapy will be reviewed under \\nthree major headings: (a) the role of emotional expression \\nin catharsis, (b) the role of emotional arousal in anxiety \\nreduction, and (c) the role of emotion in experiencing. \\nThese three areas represent the major empirical literatures \\non emotion that have been spawned by each of the three \\ntherapy traditions reviewed previously. \\nEmotional Expression \\nResearch on emotional expression has been hampered \\nby the lack of a clear-cut definition of commonly used \\nterms, such as catharsis, and a lack of a clear theoretical \\nposition on the role that expressive processes play in ther- \\napy (Greenberg & Safran, 1987a). Nevertheless, a number \\nof empirical investigations indicate that both emotional \\narousal and affective expression are related to therapeutic \\nchange. Nichols and Zax (1977) reviewed a number of \\nanalogue studies evaluating the effect of catharsis in an- \\nalogue therapy situations. Although some provided sup- \\nport for the efficacy of cathartic interventions (Dittes, \\n1957; Goldman-Eisler, 1956; Haggard & Murray, 1942; \\nLevison, Zax, & Cowen, 1961; Martin, Lundy, & Lewin, \\n1960; Ruesch & Prestwood, 1949), others were ambiguous \\n(Gordon, 1957; Grossman, 1952; Wiener, 1955), or were \\nnegative in their findings (Keet, 1948). It has also been \\nsuggested that catharsis involves cognitive as well as ex- \\npressive factors. For example, Bohart (1977), in an ana- \\nlogue study, demonstrated that subjects who expressed \\ntheir anger in a role play situation and then responded in \\nthe other role showed a greater reduction in anger and \\nhostile behavior than those who only expressed anger. \\nGreen and Murray (1975) showed that catharsis involves \\nan expression of feelings and a cognitive reinterpretation. \\nA number of studies of expressive therapy with actual \\nclients have demonstrated changes on physiological mea- \\nsures (e.g., Karle, Corriere, & Hart, 1973; Karle et al., \\n• 1976; Woldenburg, 1976). Recently a manualized gestalt \\ntherapy approach for dealing with constricted anger, fo- \\ncused expressive therapy, has shown some promise in re- \\nlieving depressive and subjective pain symptoms (Beutler \\net al., in press; Daldrup, Beutler, Engle, & Greenberg, \\n1988). Finally, a number of studies have been conducted \\ndemonstrating that the process of catharsis can bring \\nabout self-reported change (Nichols, 1974; Pierce, Ni- \\nchols, & DuBrin, 1983). The results of these studies are \\ncomplex, however, suggesting that outcome is moderated \\nby variables such as the client\\'s diagnosis, defensive style, \\nand degree of emotional expressiveness in the session; the \\nnature of the emotional material expressed (e.g., whether \\npreviously avoided or not); and whether the client has a \\ncognitive connection to these feelings. These findings \\nhighlight the importance of developing a differentiated \\nperspective on the role of emotional experience in therapy, \\na theme we will take up later in the article. \\nThe Role of Emotional Arousal in Anxiety Reduction \\nA number of empirical investigations indicate that emo- \\ntional arousal can facilitate anxiety reduction in fear- \\navoidance problems. First, a variety of studies have found \\nimplosion or flooding to be effective in the treatment of \\na variety of different phobias (Crowe, Marks, Agras, & \\nLeitenberg, 1972; Hogan & Kirchner, 1967; Levis & Car- \\nrera, 1967; Mylar & Clement, 1972). A number of studies \\nhave yielded conflicting results, however (e.g., Hekmat, \\n1973; Mealiea & Nawas, 1971), suggesting the importance \\nof clarifying under what conditions emotional arousal \\ntechniques will or will not facilitate fear reduction, as \\nwell as discovering the precise mechanisms of change. \\nIn addition, a series of studies suggests that clients \\nwho experience physiological and/or subjective emotional \\narousal when undergoing various fear-reduction proce- \\ndures (e.g., flooding, desensitization) benefit more than \\nthose who do not (Borkovec & Grayson, 1980; Borkovec \\n& Sides, 1979; Lang, 1977; Michelson, Mavissakalian & \\nMarchione, 1985; Orenstein & Carr, 1975). These studies \\nhighlight the importance of clarifying the underlying \\nchange processes in therapeutic events rather than focus- \\ning exclusively on the surface features of interventions. \\nResearch on Experiencing \\nReviews of the process and outcome literature are fairly \\nconsistent in concluding that high levels of client expe- \\nriencing are related at least in some therapeutic ap- \\nproaches to good outcome in psychotherapy (Klein, Ma- \\nthieu-Coughlin, & Kiesler, 1986; Luborsky, Chandler, \\nAuerbach, Cohen, & Bachrach, 1971; Orlinsky & How- \\nard, 1978, 1986). \\nLuborsky et al. (1971) concluded that of all process \\nmeasures, experiencing was the most repeatedly successful \\nin predicting outcome. A number of studies examining \\nthe relationship between increases in experiencing level \\nduring therapy and outcome have also produced positive \\nJanuary 1989 • American Psychologist \\n21 \\n'),\n",

On the basis \\nof their comprehensive review of the literature relating \\nprocess to outcome, Orlinsky and Howard (1978) con- \\neluded that \"in client-centered therapy at least, high levels \\nof process functioning and especially \\'experiencing\" in \\npatient communications are consistently predictive of \\ntherapeutic outcome\" (p. 305). \\nIn their more updated review of the experiencing \\nliterature, Klein et al. (1986) drew somewhat more mod- \\nerate conclusions but nevertheless interpreted the evi- \\ndence to suggest that \"experiencing reflects a process of \\nproductive engagement in the work of therapy that is re- \\nlated to the ultimate outcome of therapy\" (p. 52). A \\nnumber of studies have found that when client experi- \\nencing level is averaged across or over sessions, it is pos- \\nitively correlated with outcome (Gendlin et al., 1968; \\nKiesler, 1971; Kiesler, Mathieu, & Klein, 1967; Kirtner, \\nCartwright, Robertson, & Fiske, 1961; Stoler, 1963; \\nTomlinson & Hart, 1962; Tomlinson & Stoler, 1967; van \\nder Veen, 1967; Walker, Rablen, & Rogers, 1966). Not \\nall studies are consistent with this trend (e.g., Custers, \\n1973; Richert, 1976; Tomlinson, 1967). As Klein et al. \\n(1986) concluded, positive results are more likely to \\nemerge when sessions are sampled toward the end of \\ntherapy than toward the beginning of therapy. \\nStudies investigating the relationship between \\nchanges in experiencing level over the course of therapy \\nand outcome have been somewhat less decisive, but are \\ngenerally supportive of the idea that experiencing plays \\nan important role in change (e.g., Gendlin et al., 1968; \\nGreenberg & Rice, 1981; Kiesler et al., 1967; Tomlinson, \\n1967; Tomlinson & Hart, 1962). \\nIn general then, the evidence suggests that experi- \\nencing is related to outcome. What is less clear is whether \\nit is a capacity that clients bring to therapy or a perfor- \\nmance variable affected by therapy. In addition, it appears \\nthat experiencing varies across and within sessions, and \\nit is more a matter of defining when in therapy deeper \\nexperiencing is productive than claiming that deep ex- \\nperiencing is a blanket requirement for therapy to be ef- \\nfective (Rice & Greenberg, 1984). \\nA Differential Approach \\nAs the preceding brief review suggests, the empirical ev- \\nidence does indicate that emotion can play a role in ther- \\napeutic change. The research reviewed, however, high- \\nlights the importance of a more differentiated view of \\nemotional change that distinguishes between various types \\nof emotional processes rather than lumping them together \\nunder a common rubric such as catharsis, deconditionine= \\nor experiencing. \\nEmotion has been treated in various ways by differ- \\nent therapies: It has been viewed as irrational, as destruc- \\ntive, as an epiphenomenon, or as an aspect of adaptive \\nbiological functioning. Clearly, all of these are possible. \\nIf we are to have a comprehensive understanding of emo- \\ntion in therapy, a more differentiated, multifaceted view \\nof emotion and its function in the process of change is \\nrequired. No single therapeutic perspective can encom- \\npass all of emotional functioning in therapy. Attempts to \\ndo so have led to unnecessary disagreements and con- \\nceptual confusion because different investigators have \\nbeen discussing emotion in general but have been focusing \\non different affective phenomena without being aware of \\nit (Greenberg & Safran, 1984a, 1984b, 1987a). Greater \\nprecision in the area of affective assessment is greatly \\nneeded in order to deal with this problem. \\nIn addition to suggesting that assessment of different \\nforms of emotional processing in therapy is greatly \\nneeded, we also suggest that different types of emotionally \\nfocused interventions be used for different types of emo- \\ntional processing problems. Different methods of working \\nwith affective processes already exist in a variety of ther- \\napeutic orientations. What is needed is a clear delineation \\nof these different methods, specification of the type of \\nproblems they best address, and an explication of the \\nprocesses of change involved in different emotionally fo- \\ncused change events (Greenberg, 1986; Greenberg & \\nWebster, 1982; Rice & Greenberg, 1984). Emotion does \\nnot play a simple, uniform role in all psychotherapeutic \\nchange. We should not ask a question as global as \"Does \\nemotional experience in therapy lead to change?\" Rather \\nwe should be asking \"What type of emotional processing \\nproblem in therapy can best be corrected by what kind \\nof intervention?\" \\nThe second limitation apparent in psychotherapy \\nliterature on the role of emotion in psychotherapy is the \\nfailure to forge systematic links with theory and research \\nin mainstream experimental psychology. This type of \\ntheoretical isolation from the mainstream of psychology \\nhas resulted in too much therapeutic dogma, development \\nof too many esoteric languages, and the inability to com- \\npare and evaluate different views of therapeutic change. \\nIn the next section we will elaborate on an integrative \\ntheory of emotional processing now emerging in the lit- \\nerature that could help provide the needed framework \\nfor understanding emotional processes in therapy. \\nA Constructive Theory of Emotional \\nProcessing \\nA number of psychological investigators have begun to \\ndemonstrate that certain primary emotions, identified by \\nfacial and gestural expressions, are widely generalized \\nwithin the human species (Ekman, 1972; Izard, 1977; \\nTomkins, t962). Demonstrations that human facial \\nexpressions of emotion bear resemblances to certain an- \\nimal emotional expressions, as well as evidence of cross- \\nspecies similarity in emotion physiology (Gray, 1982; \\nPanskepp, 1982), suggest that emotions are products of \\nevolution. These investigators hypothesize that primary \\nemotions are biologically adaptive responses that reflect \\nsurvival needs and promote survival oriented problem \\nsolving. \\nEarly on, Arnold (1960) argued that emotions were \\nnot simply subjective internal events but rather were bio- \\nlogically adaptive action tendencies.

Lang (1985) \\nhas referred to emotions as dispositions to act. Emotions \\nare thus viewed as motivational in nature, generating \\nrapid, immediate action tendencies. In humans, these \\ntendencies are mediated by higher level information pro- \\ncessing that elaborates the action tendencies into con- \\nscious emotional experience and intended actions. In this \\nview, emotions are seen as a synthesis of different levels \\nof emotional processing that can potentially motivate \\nadaptive behavior (Lang, 1985; Leventhal, 1982, 1984). \\nAlthough there is some disagreement among emo- \\ntion theorists as to which emotions are primarily biolog- \\nically based and which emotions are more complex and \\nculturally derived, there is agreement among all theorists \\nwho hold a biological/evolutionary perspective on emo- \\ntion that the structure for certain primary core emotions \\nis wired into the human organism. Consistent with the- \\norists such as Arnold (1960) and Leventhal (1979, 1982), \\nwe hypothesize that the neurological substrate for emo- \\ntional experience is wired in and that it includes a code \\nfor specific configurations of expressive motor behaviors \\nthat correspond to specific primary emotions including \\nat least the six emotions with identifiable facial expres- \\nsionsnfear, anger, sadness, surprise, disgust, and joy \\n(Ekman, 1972; Ekman & Friesen, 1975). We are not \\nclaiming, however, that emotional experience in the adult \\nhuman being is in any sense restricted to these simple, \\nprimary emotions and associated expressive motor con- \\nfigurations. Rather, our perspective is that the basic neu- \\nrological template for emotional experience becomes \\nelaborated in the human being into subtle blends of emo- \\ntional experience, such as love, pride, envy, and humility, \\nthat are characteristic of human functioning. \\nIn this model of emotion, the human organism is \\nseen as responding to the environment in an immediate, \\nreflexive fashion. The type of immediate appraisals (Ar- \\nnold, 1970; Zajonc, 1980) humans make of the environ- \\nment relate to biological and psychological survival. Peo- \\nple engage in immediate perceptual motor appraisals of \\nenvironmental events, which are not dependent on a prior \\nstage of conceptual appraisal. These events are, however, \\nsubjected to an ongoing conceptual appraisal as they take \\nplace. This conceptual appraisal becomes increasingly \\nsophisticated as the organism develops. As this parallel \\nappraisal process takes place, people accumulate memory \\nstores consisting of images of eliciting environmental \\nevents, evoked expressive motor responses, associated \\nautonomic arousal, and conceptual appraisals. Emotional \\nexperience thus becomes coded in memory structures or \\nnetworks that incorporate components from expressive \\nmotor, schematic, and conceptual levels of the informa- \\ntion processing system (Leventhal, 1982). When an in- \\ndividual either attends to information or generates infor- \\nmation internally that matches one of the components of \\nthe network, the probability increases that other asso- \\nciated components will become activated. As Lang (1983) \\nmaintained, an emotion network (or as he called it, an \\nemotion prototype) becomes automatically activated and \\nprocessed when an individual attends to information that \\nmatches sufficient coded propositions in the prototype. \\nOnce the right propositions or combinations thereof are \\nmatched in a stimulus array, the entire emotion prototype \\nis automatically activated and processed. The individual \\nthus experiences an emotion consciously, resulting from \\nthe preattentive integration of autonomic/expressive mo- \\ntor, schematic, and conceptual components of the net- \\nwork. The experience of emotion thus indicates that a \\ncognitive-affective network has been activated and is cur- \\nrently operating. \\nA number of different problems can arise in this \\ntype of system, however. One set of problems is the in- \\nability to synthesize certain immediate expressive motor \\nresponses and primary appraisals. Another set of prob- \\nlems can arise from the automatic cuing, at a preattentive \\nlevel, of schematic emotional memories without these \\nbeing fully processed consciously. This automatic pro- \\ncessing can lead to inexplicable problematic feelings. \\nProblems can also arise from discrepancies between levels \\nof processing, particularly when the conceptual level con- \\nrains injunctions against material in schematic memory \\nor against certain expressive motor responses. Finally, \\nschematic memories can be repositories of negative emo- \\ntional associations and response sequences. \\nEmotionally Focused Intervention \\nWe believe in the importance of explicating a significant \\ndomain of therapeutic practice, rather than in promoting \\na new school of therapy. Thus, we have been attempting \\nto map out and study the parameters of emotionally fo- \\ncused therapy within the preceding framework of a net- \\nwork theory of emotion, both for individuals (Greenberg \\n& Safran, 1981, 1984a, 1987a, 1987b; Safran & Green- \\nberg, 1982a, 1982b, 1986, in press) and couples (Green- \\nberg & Johnson, 1985, 1986a, 1986b, 1988; Johnson, \\n1986; Johnson & Greenberg, 1985a, 1985b). Taking an \\nemotionally focused approach to therapy involves viewing \\nparticular classes of emotion as allies in a change process \\nrather than as negative or undesirable aspects of client \\nperformance to be bypassed or extinguished. As Simon \\n(1967) has noted, it is generally adaptive to give a high \\npriority, in terms of attention and cognitive processing, \\nto goals or information with which emotion is associated, \\nparticularly when it is intense. The blocking or avoidance \\nof potentially adaptive emotions and the information as- \\nsociated with them can thus lead to poor problem solving, \\nwhereas the complete processing of specific emotional \\nexperience can lead to the emergence of new, more adap- \\ntive responses. \\nEmotional intervention can be seen to fall into a \\nnumber of different classes, each involving different pro- \\ncedures and promoting different processes of change. Five \\ngeneral processes of change are (a) synthesizing and ac- \\nknowledging previously unacknowledged emotional re- \\nsponses in order to increase awareness of adaptive re- \\nsponse information; (b) the evocation and intensification \\nof emotion to motivate new behavioral responses; (c) \\nemotional restructuring, that is, evoking the network un- \\nJanuary 1989 • American Psychologist \\n23 \\n'),\n",

As is generally recognized, it can be ther- \\napeutically useful for people to \"get in touch\" with af- \\nfective responses that are not normally attended to (Dav- \\nison, 1980; Wexler, 1974) and to own disclaimed action \\ntendencies (Eagle, 1984; Schafer, 1983) associated with \\nthe feelings. The importance of the acknowledgment of \\naffect is based on the adaptive nature of primary affective \\nresponses and on the importance of accessing this infor- \\nmation to aid problem solving. Organisms that ignore \\ntheir own affective feedback are not well situated to behave \\nadaptively. Acknowledging affective responses that were \\npreviously disallowed makes certain reactions and moods \\nmore understandable and acknowledging disclaimed ten- \\ndencies provides new impetus for action and need satis- \\nfaction. Acting in the world to satisfy certain needs is a \\nsine qua non of competence and satisfaction. Without \\nacknowledgment of feelings and desires, people feel \\nempty, confused, and often fragmented, and they lack the \\nimpetus from the action tendencies to motivate action. \\nOne of the thorny questions regarding the acknowl- \\nedgment of emotion has been whether the emotion existed \\nin some form out of awareness prior to acknowledgment. \\nOn the basis of a constructive theory of emotional pro- \\ncessing, we argue (Greenberg & Safran, 1987a) that emo- \\ntional experience is a conscious experience. This expe- \\nrience comes into consciousness by a tacit synthesis of \\nsubsidiary information. Acknowledgment of emotion is \\nthus the process of synthesizing subsidiary information \\n(not in awareness) in the present in a particular fashion \\nto produce conscious experience. Prior to acknowledg- \\nment, these conscious emotions exist only as potentials. \\nSubsidiary components, such as the expressive motor re- \\nsponse, however, do actually exist outside of awareness \\nand can be more or less accurately synthesized. Thus, \\nacknowledgment is a process both of discovery and cre- \\nation in which certain constitutive elements, such as ex- \\npressive motor responses, schematic memories, and tacit \\nrules are synthesized along with perception of the situation \\ninto a particular current self-organization. Certain self- \\nexperiences such as feeling vulnerable or angry emerge \\nas present constructions. \\nOften in therapy, this synthesis involves the client\\'s \\nallowing into awareness an organization of experience \\npreviously regarded as unacceptable and then accepting \\nthis experience. With the acceptance of the feeling comes \\nthe recognition of the action tendency associated with it. \\nFully accepting the feeling implies accepting the want or \\ndesire that goes with it. Wants and desires need to be \\nsymbolized in awareness and their implications explored. \\nThe acknowledgment and experience of emotion brings \\nrelief mainly when the action organized by the emotion \\ncan be expressed in some acceptable form. \\nIn the second category, evocation of emotion, in- \\ncreasing emotional arousal is used as a means of changing \\nbehavior (Greenberg & Johnson, 1988; Greenberg & Saf- \\nran, 1987a). In this process, emotion is intensified using \\nexpressive methods. Thus, the experiences of anger can \\nbe evoked in therapy to promote assertiveness (Kahn & \\nGreenberg, 1980), sadness to promote contact or comfort \\nseeking behavior, and fear and vulnerability to promote \\nless dominant or less aggressive behaviors (Greenberg & \\nJohnson, 1985, 1986a, 1986b, 1988). In this process, spe- \\ncific emotions are evoked in order to access the action \\ntendency associated with them. The action tendency is \\nthen elaborated into the behavioral response that the \\nclient is lacking or that would help alleviate the assessed \\ndistress. The emotional experience and the associated ac- \\ntion tendency can be evoked by various means of emo- \\ntional stimulation, both verbal and nonverbal. Often, ex- \\npressive nonverbal means of stimulation such as use of \\nimagery, enactments, music, and drawing are most effec- \\nfive, but verbal means such as repetition and exaggeration \\nof certain key phrases by the client can also be effective \\nin arousing emotion. \\nIn the third category, emotional restructuring, the \\nunderlying problematic response program needs to be \\naccessed and run in order to make it amenable to restruc- \\nturing. As Lang (1983) has pointed out, the more the \\nstimulus configuration matches the prototype or internal \\nstructure, the more likely it is that the network will be \\nevoked. The presence of the emotional responses them- \\nselves, such as the experience of fear, sadness, or anger, \\nis necessary before the experience can be restructured. \\nThe therapeutic situation needs to be used as a laboratory \\nfor evoking and reprocessing reactions in order to re- \\nstructure the cognitive/affective/behavioral network or \\nscheme. Restructuring is achieved by admitting new in- \\nformation to the scheme, thereby altering its organization. \\nInterventions ranging from evocative responding (Rice, \\n1974; Rice & Saperia, 1984) to the use of focusing (Gend- \\nlin, 1981) and imagery (Shorr, 1974) to enactments and \\ngestalt two chair dialogues (Greenberg, 1984; Greenberg \\n& Safran, 1987a) help access and set in motion the af- \\nfective, cognitive, and behavioral response patterns that \\nneed to be modified. Once the cognitive-affective network \\nis amenable, different processes of change including \\nawareness, provision of new evidence, generation of \\nschema-inconsistent information, success experience, \\npositive conditioning, and creation of new meanings can \\nall be used to produce restructuring. In our experience, \\nthe activation of the network for conscious reevaluation \\nand working through of its contents is highly therapeutic \\n(Greenberg & Safran, 1987a). \\nIn the fourth category, accessing state-dependent core \\nbeliefs, evocation of emotional experience makes previ- \\nously inaccessible beliefs available to consciousness. Once \\navailable, these state-dependent cognitions and the mal- \\nadaptive cognitive-affective sequences associated with \\nthem become amenable to cognitive modification. As we \\nhave elaborated elsewhere (Greenberg & Safran, 1984a, \\n1984b, 1987a; Safran & Greenberg, 1982a, 1986), it is \\n24 \\nJanuary 1989 • American Psychologist \\n'),\n",

Thus, by \\ndeepening the emotional experience of particular events \\nand intensifying relevant emotional states, the full impact \\nof the beliefs and their effect on experience become avail- \\nable. Once the experience is sufficiently deepened and the \\ncore beliefs become accessible, they can be understood \\nboth in terms of how they came about and how they act \\nto structure current experience. \\nThe fifth change process involves the modification \\nof primary emotional responses. Notwithstanding the \\nbiologically adaptive nature of primary emotion, there \\nare instances in which primary responses have become \\ndysfunctional or maladaptive. There are a variety of oc- \\ncasions in therapy when certain entrenched affective re- \\nsponses can present major problems. For example, a neg- \\native learning history may have led to a type of condi- \\ntioned evaluative response (Greenberg & Safran, 1987b; \\nLevey & Martin, 1983), such as fear of harmless stimuli \\nor anger in response to affection. In our view, it is possible \\nto modify the expressive motor response and primary \\nappraisal by modifying the network. This can be done \\nby using a variety of modification procedures, such as \\nexposure to the feared stimuli, restructuring of cognitions, \\nand practice and reinforcement of new responses. The \\ndifference between our view and a simple conditioning \\nmodel is that we regard the learning process as involving \\nthe conditioning of subjective evaluations. These subjec- \\ntive evaluations are intrinsically linked to expressive mo- \\ntor responses as components in a total network. \\nIn this article, we have identified a number of classes \\nof emotional change processes. Some of these processes \\nand the therapeutic methods used to promote them have \\nrecently begun to be investigated (Beutler et al., in press; \\nClarke & Greenberg, 1986; Greenberg, 1984, 1986; \\nJohnson & Greenberg, 1985a, 1985b; Pierce, Nichols, & \\nDuBrin, 1983). Further research is needed to evaluate \\nthese processes and to establish when and with whom the \\nvarious classes of emotionally focused interventions are \\nuseful. \\nGeneral Therapeutic Principles \\nSome of the general principles governing emotionally fo- \\ncused intervention are summarized here to provide an \\nidea of the type of therapeutic style suggested in working \\nwith emotion. First, assessment of the ongoing client pro- \\ncess is of great significance in working with emotional \\nprocesses in psychotherapy. Before one chooses whether \\nto access, stimulate, modify, or bypass different expres- \\nsions, one must make a process diagnosis (Greenberg, \\n1986; Rice & Greenberg, 1984) as to the current type of \\nprocessing used by the client. Second, on the basis of this \\nassessment of the client\\'s current state, the therapist in- \\ntervenes so as to direct the client\\'s internal processing in \\nways that will change the client\\'s emotional state. \\nWe have suggested (Greenberg & Safran, 1984b, \\n1987a) that for the purpose of intervention, distinctions \\ninitially need to be made at least between the following \\nfour broad categories of emotional expression: (a) adap- \\ntive primary emotion, (b) secondary emotion, (c) instru- \\nmental emotion, and (d) maladaptive primary emotion. \\nWe will consider each of these in turn. \\nBiologically adaptive primary affective responses. \\nThese experiences provide information to the organism \\nabout its responses to situations. Emotions such as anger \\nat violation, sadness at loss, and fear in response to danger \\nprovide adaptive action tendencies to help organize ap- \\npropriate behavior. Anger mobilizes people for fight, fear \\nfor flight, and sadness for recovery of that which has been \\nlost and for reparative grieving. These emotions are often \\nnot initially in awareness and are to be accessed and in- \\ntensified in therapy and used as aids to problem solving. \\nSecondary reactive emotional responses. These re- \\nsponses are often problematic and are not the organism\\'s \\ndirect response to the environment. Rather, they are sec- \\nondary to some underlying, more primary generating \\nprocess or are reactions to the thwarting of primary re- \\nsponses. Defensive or reactive responses, such as crying \\nin frustration when angry or expressing anger when afraid, \\nare secondary emotional responses to underlying emo- \\ntional processes. In addition, emotions such as fear in \\nresponse to anticipated danger or hopelessness in response \\nto negative expectations are secondary emotional re- \\nsponses to underlying cognitive processes. Secondary re- \\nactive responses of these types are not to be focused on \\nor intensified in therapy; rather, they are to be bypassed \\nor explored in order to access underlying processes. Sec- \\nondary emotions are generally readily available to aware- \\nness and often are part of the presenting problem. \\nInstrumental emotional responses. These responses \\nare emotional behavior patterns that people have learned \\nto use to influence others. These emotions are expressed \\nin order to achieve some intended effect, such as crying \\nin order to evoke sympathy or expressing anger in order \\nto dominate. Instrumental expressions of this type are \\nnot information about responses to situations but at- \\ntempts to influence. In therapy, these expressions are best \\nbypassed, confronted, or interpreted, not explored or dif- \\nferentiated to access adaptive information. \\nLearned maladaptive primary responses to the en- \\nvironment. Such maladaptive responses include fear in \\nreaction to harmless stimuli or anger in response to earing. \\nAs we have suggested, although the emotional response \\nsystem generally plays an adaptive role in human func- \\ntioning, maladaptive responses can be learned as a func- \\ntion of trauma or strongly negative environmental con- \\ntingencies in childhood. These emotions then need to be \\naccessed in therapy, but they are to be modified, rather \\nthan used for orientation. \\nAssessing the type of emotion being expressed in \\ntherapy thus provides the clinician with a notion of what \\nto do and when. Primary and maladaptive expression, as \\nopposed to secondary and instrumental expression, need \\nto be accessed in therapy, and for different purposes. Pri- \\nmary adaptive emotion is accessed for its orientation in- \\nformation, whereas maladaptive emotion is accessed to \\nmake it more amenable to modification and restructuring. \\nJanuary 1989 • American Psychologist \\n25 \\n'),\n",

These principles \\nare based on a distillation of the essential therapist op- \\nerations involved in the practice of emotionally focused \\ninterventions (Gendlin, 1981, Greenberg & Safran, 1987a; \\nPerls et al., 1951; Polster & Polster, 1973; Rogers, 1959). \\nThese principles of therapeutic process guide the moment- \\nby-moment interventions of the therapist in an approach \\nto therapy that is highly attuned to shifts in the ongoing \\nexperiential process in the client. \\nWorking with these principles, the therapist directs \\nthe client\\'s information processing in particular ways, and \\nthis deepens experience and promotes the generation of \\nnew meaning. The primary operation involves directing \\nattentional allocation. Emotion is accessed by directing \\nclients to attend to their internal experience. The therapist \\ncan direct the client\\'s attention by directly suggesting that \\nthe client attend to what he or she is feeling, or by asking \\n\"what are you experiencing?\" or by directing a response \\nat the client\\'s internal experience, such as \"I hear some \\nsadness as you say this.\" If and when clients move their \\nattentional allocation away from their internal experience, \\nthe therapist refocuses the clients\\' attention inward to \\nattend to bodily felt experience (Gendlin, 1981). Refo- \\ncusing involves noticing when clients deflect from a de- \\nscription of an internal experiential track and redirecting \\nthem to this inner track. The focus in accessing affect is \\npredominantly on what is occurring in the present in \\nclients\\' experience. Affect is being synthesized in the \\npresent from elements that are currently activated. The \\ntherapist therefore brings clients\\' attentional focus to what \\nis occurring internally right now. Whatever is currently \\noccurring is of greatest interest, be it a memory of the \\npast, a present sensation, or an anticipation of the future: \\nIts present liveliness is of greatest importance. In addition \\nto focusing on current bodily felt experiences, the ther- \\napist carefully analyzes clients\\' manner of verbal and \\nnonverbal expression, as it is occurring, as an important \\nsource of information about affective states. Facial, pos- \\ntural, and vocal expression convey a great deal about what \\na person is feeling. How things are said is often as infor- \\nmative as what is being said. Sighs, gestures, glances, and \\nmovements all convey a vast amount of information about \\na person\\'s state. It is important for the therapist to use \\nthese as cues for refocusing the client on his or her con- \\ncerns. The client is thus directed to attend to and use this \\ninformation. It is often the more indirect observation of \\na nonverbal expression that is most effective. Rather than \\nsaying directly \"Become aware of your face or your pos- \\nture,\" the therapist will ask \"What do you feel as you \\ncurl your lip, or as you hang your head?\" Asking clients \\nwhat they feel as they sigh can often rapidly connect them \\nto a well of inner experience. \\nEmerging experience is intensified by increasing the \\nperson\\'s general level of arousal. This makes the experi- \\nence more vivid and clear. Arousal can be increased by \\nengaging clients in physical activities such as hitting, yell- \\ning, or moving or by increasing the vividness ofimaginal \\nrepresentations. Experience can also be intensified by en- \\nacting what is being talked about; for example, a client \\ncan curl up into a ball or take on a pleading position to \\nheighten the relevant experience. Exaggeration or repe- \\ntition of phrases such as \"I needed someone to take care \\nof me\" or gestures such as wagging a scolding finger also \\nserve to intensify experience. Indiscriminate intensifi- \\ncation of emotion without accurate assessment of the \\ncorrect primary emotion to intensify, however, can be \\nhighly unproductive and often harmful. Intensification \\nshould therefore be used only by therapists comfortable \\nwith and knowledgeable about working with emotion. \\nThe final principles involve working with clients toward \\nsymbolizing their current experience and stating inten- \\ntions based on needs or wants. The latter two principles \\nserve to promote the creation of new meaning and the \\nprovision of a sense of direction for action in the world. \\nSymbolization of experience makes the inner world more \\namenable to clarification and elaboration and more \\navailable for recall. In this process, patterns of meaning \\nare drawn from, rather than imposed on, experience. Af- \\nter the client has become aware of feelings and begun to \\nsymbolize experience, the therapist moves the client to- \\nward statements of intent. It is only after the feelings are \\nin awareness that the action tendency associated with \\nthem can be sensed. The therapist often asks what the \\nclient needs or wants based on newly experienced feeling \\nin order to get at the directional tendency of the emotion. \\nThis action tendency is then integrated with goals, plans, \\nand reality assessments of the situation to form an inten- \\ntion. The establishment of intentions forms the bridge \\nbetween subjective experience and action in the world. \\nThus, in an emotionally focused intervention, the \\ntherapist tracks the client\\'s moment-by-moment experi- \\nence. The therapist works continually to highlight and \\ndevelop aspects of the client\\'s experience, focusing on a \\nphrase here or a gesture there. A particular vocal quality \\nmay serve to indicate a direction for deepening an ex- \\nperience, a sigh may suggest the client\\'s sense of sadness, \\nor the shape of the mouth may indicate tearfulness. All \\nthese emerging experiences are supported by the therapist \\nuntil an experientially based core scheme emerges. The \\naccessing of emotion is thus primarily a process of di- \\nrecting the client to attend to internal information and \\nsupporting the construction of new meaning structures \\nbased on the newly accessed experiential information. \\nThese principles describe a style of therapeutic in- \\ntervention that, guided as it is by the emerging experience \\nof the moment, is inherently nonlinear.

Without a relationship bond \\nin which clients feel accepted, safe, and supported, they \\nwill not enter into exploration of their feelings. \\nIn addition to this sense of acceptance in the \"safe \\nenough\" environment, a good working alliance requires \\nthat clients sense they are working together with their \\ntherapists to overcome the obstacles in their paths and \\nthat clients feel hopeful or optimistic that what they are \\ndoing in therapy will help (Alexander & Luborsky, 1986; \\nGreenberg & Pinsof, 1986). In order to promote affective \\nwork in therapy, clients must feel that they are in agree- \\nment with their therapists as to the goals of therapy and \\nthat the affective tasks in which they are engaged are rel- \\nevant to these goals (Bordin, 1979; Horvath & Greenberg, \\n1986). Without these relationship conditions, no amount \\nof focusing an affect will produce the experiential process \\nthat we have described. \\nConclusion \\nThe role of emotion in psychotherapeutic change is both \\nvitally important and complex. No single concept such \\nas \"catharsis\" does it justice. Possibly, because of the ap- \\nparent inexplicability of the \"passions,\" theorists and \\ntherapists alike have until recently stayed away from at- \\ntempting to explain and investigate this most human of \\nall phenomena. As investigators begin to explicate differ- \\nent categories of emotional expression in therapy, different \\nprocesses of affective change, and different principles of \\nintervention, we hope that the fog that has shrouded the \\nrole of emotion in psychotherapy will begin to lift and \\nallow us to specify and measure how emotion is involved \\nin therapeutic change. Unless we grapple with the role of \\nemotion in therapy, our understanding of the human \\nchange process will remain hollow, missing some of the \\nvital elements of what makes psychotherapy a potentially \\npowerful change process. \\nREFERENCF~ \\nAlexander, E, & French, T.

According to the American \\nPsychological Association (APA), emotion is defined as “a complex \\nreaction pattern, involving experiential, behavioral and physiological \\nelements.” Emotions are how individuals deal with matters or \\nsituations they find personally significant. Emotional experiences \\nhave three components: a subjective experience, a physiological \\nresponse and a behavioral or expressive response. \\nFeelings arise from an emotional experience. Because a person is \\nconscious of the experience, this is classified in the same category \\nas hunger or pain. A feeling is the result of an emotion and may be \\ninfluenced by memories, beliefs and other factors. \\nA mood is described by the APA as “any short-lived emotional state, \\nusually of low intensity.” Moods differ from emotions because they \\nlack stimuli and have no clear starting point. For example, insults can \\ntrigger the emotion of anger while an angry mood may arise without \\napparent cause. \\nDefining emotions is a task that is not yet complete. Many researchers \\nare still proposing theories about what makes up our emotions, and \\nexisting theories are constantly being challenged.

This \\nphysiological response is the result of the autonomic nervous system’s \\nreaction to the emotion we’re experiencing. The autonomic nervous \\nsystem controls our involuntary bodily responses and regulates our \\nfight-or-flight response. According to many psychologists, our \\nphysiological responses are likely how emotion helped us evolve and \\nsurvive as humans throughout history. \\nInterestingly, studies have shown autonomic physiological responses \\nare strongest when a person’s facial expressions most closely resemble \\nthe expression of the emotion they’re experiencing. In other words, \\nfacial expressions play an important role in responding accordingly to \\nan emotion in a physical sense. \\nBehavioral Responses\\nThe behavioral response aspect of the emotional response is the \\nactual expression of the emotion. Behavioral responses can include a \\nsmile, a grimace, a laugh or a sigh, along with many other reactions \\ndepending on societal norms and personality. \\nWhile plentiful research suggests that many facial expressions are \\nuniversal, such as a frown to indicate sadness, sociocultural norms \\nand individual upbringings play a role in our behavioral responses. \\nFor example, how love is expressed is different both from person to \\nperson and across cultures. \\n'),\n",

Thus, \\nmany theories of emotion exist. While some theories directly refute \\nothers, many build upon each other. Here are some common theories \\nof emotional psychology that have helped shape the field and how \\nhumans view emotions.\\nJames-Lange Theory\\nThe James-Lange Theory of Emotion is one of the earliest emotion \\ntheories of modern psychology. Developed by William James and Carl \\nLange in the 19th century, the theory hypothesizes that physiological \\nstimuli (arousal) causes the autonomic nervous system to react which \\nin turn causes individuals to experience emotion. The reactions of \\nthe nervous system could include a fast heartbeat, tensed muscles, \\nsweating and more. According to this theory, the physiological \\nresponse comes before the emotional behavior. Over time, the James-\\nLange theory has been challenged, as well as expanded upon in other \\ntheories, suggesting that emotion is the mix of physiological and \\npsychological response. \\n'),\n",

This theory is connected to the \\nwork of Charles Darwin and William James that hypothesized that \\nfacial expressions impact emotion as opposed to their being a response \\nto an emotion. This theory holds that emotions are directly tied to \\nphysical changes in the facial muscles. Thus, someone who forced \\nhimself to smile would be happier than someone who wore a frown. \\nCannon-Bard Theory\\nDeveloped by Walter Cannon and Philip Bard in the 1920s, the \\nCannon-Bard Theory of Emotion was developed to refute the James-\\nLange theory. This theory posits that bodily changes and emotions \\noccur simultaneously instead of one right after the other. This \\ntheory is backed by neurobiological science that says that the once a \\nstimulating event is detected, the information is relayed to both the \\namygdala and the brain cortex at the same time. If this holds true, \\narousal and emotion are a simultaneous event. \\n'),\n",

Singer, \\nintroduces the element of reasoning into the process of emotion. The \\ntheory hypothesizes that when we experience an event that causes \\nphysiological arousal, we try to find a reason for the arousal. Then, we \\nexperience the emotion. \\nCognitive Appraisal Theory\\nRichard Lazarus pioneered this theory of emotion. According to the \\nCognitive Appraisal Theory, thinking must occur before experiencing \\nemotion. Thus, a person would first experience a stimulus, think, \\nand then simultaneously experience a physiological response and the \\nemotion. \\nThese are far from the only theories of emotion that exist, but they \\nprovide great examples of how the ideas about how emotion is \\ngenerated differ from each other.

It would also be a very dull \\nlife. Because, basically, our emotions drive us — excitement, pleasure, \\neven anger.” That is why it’s important that we’re able to understand \\nemotions as they play such an important role in how we behave.\\nEkman argues that emotions are fundamentally constructive. They \\nare influenced by what is good for our species overall and what we \\nlearned during our upbringing. They guide our behavior in a way that \\nshould lead us to a positive outcome. However, emotions can become \\ndestructive if the emotions we’ve learned are the correct response no \\nlonger fit our situation, or if subconscious emotions cause reactions \\nthat we are unable to understand. Being in touch with your emotions \\nand turning your understanding into action is called emotional \\nawareness. Being able to do this with others as well is referred to as \\nemotional intelligence.\\nEmotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate \\nemotions. The term was first coined by researchers Peter Salovey and \\nJohn D. Mayer and found popularity through Dan Goleman’s 1996 \\nbook. They define it as the ability to recognize, understand and manage \\nour own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence \\nthose of others. The study of emotional intelligence has gained \\nmuch popularity since the mid-1990s, with business professionals, \\nrelationship coaches and more using the term to encourage others \\n'),\n",
