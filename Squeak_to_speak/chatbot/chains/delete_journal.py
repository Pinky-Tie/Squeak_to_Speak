# User Story: I want to delete entries from my journal to maintain control over the information stored about me.

# Chain 1
# Goal: Delete the entry the user has requested to be deleted
# Implementation: This chain identifies the entry the user wishes to delete and deletes it, outputting confirmation from the database.


# Chain 2
# Goal: Inform the user that the entry has been deleted
# Implementation: This chain receives both inputs (user input and deletion confirmation) and generates a final output using a prompt template.
