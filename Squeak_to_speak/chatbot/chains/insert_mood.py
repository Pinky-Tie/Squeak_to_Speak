# User Story: I want to revisit past entries in my journal or mood board to reflect, recall and understand my experiences and emotions over time.

# Chain 1
# Goal: Retrieve the entries the users want to see
# Implementation: This chain queries the database for matching entries, ordering and structuring them as output.


# Chain 2
# Goal: Present these entries to the user
# Implementation: This chain receives all inputs (user input and structured entries) and generates a final output using a prompt template.
